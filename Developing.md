# Introduction #

[Maven2](http://maven.apache.org/) is used to manage XRemoting project lifecycle. So, building, testing and so on are standard for Maven2-powered projects.

# How to build #

```
mvn package
```

This will produce xremoting-core-${version}.jar in the xremoting-core/target directory.

# How to test #

```
